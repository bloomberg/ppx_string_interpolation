## Rationale

This PPX implements string interpolation with embedded expressions,
thus enabling simple and powerful templates for code generation and
pretty printing. In contrast to `printf`, string interpolation does not
separate embedded variables and context, which is important for
medium-size strings (several lines).

We tried our best to be compatible with future Compiler versions,
so please do not be surprised if the package is not updated for
a couple years â€” it works. Please feel free to file an ISSUE if
the Compiler update breaks this PPX.

## Quick Start

Plugin uses bash-style syntax for string interpolation and
the type of variables and expressions is assumed to be string
by default:
```ocaml
let name = "world" in
    [%string "Hello $name!"]
```

Embedded expressions should be enclosed in parentheses:
```ocaml
let hello = "Hello" and world = "world" in
    [%string "$(hello ^ \" \" ^ world)!"]
```

### Non-string types

Since this PPX run before type inference and type checking, rewriter should
have the information about the types of embedded values via `Printf.printf`
format specifiers:
```ocaml
let a = 1 and b = 1.0 in
    [%string {|We know, that %d$a == %f$b is %b$(a = int_of_float b)!|}]
```

### Advanced usage

The extension is essentially syntax sugar for the `Printf.sprintf` function.
The format is assumed to be anything between `%` and the next `$`. The expression
string is determined by searching for balanced parentheses.

Both `$` and `%` symbols can be escaped, i.e. double `%` and
double `$` result in single characters:

```ocaml
[%string "This is $$ and %%!"] = "This is $ and %!"
```

If the expression is commented out, the PPX dumps the comment with format,
without checking for the type of the format:

```ocaml
[%string "The first pythagorean triple: %d$(3), 4, %d$(*5?*)"] =
    "The first pythagorean triple: 3, 4, %d$(*5?*)"
```
